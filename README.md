Chrome Extension: PopUpToNewTab

This Extension disables disabling cut/paste/copy.

== What is 

We are getting annoyed. Pressing Ctrl+V result no action ...  
Why we  mustinput mail address over again and again.


Many Japanese sites send me e-mail in the process of registration.
Wrong mail address would be found  by no mail recive.

So  oncopy="return false" onpaste="return false" oncontextmenu="return false" in registration is USELESS.

I wrote disable oncopy/onpaste/oncontextmenu .
